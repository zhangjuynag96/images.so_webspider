# A crawler for images.so.com.
## The environment you need to configure:
- python 3.x
- scrapy frame
- mongodb
## *url:https://images.so.com*
### Build a crawl URL via ajax:**data = {'ch': 'beauty', 'listtype': 'new'}**
### One thing: ***You can change the type of the crawled image by changing the value of the ‘ch’ key.***
## Overall, this is an interesting attempt.
